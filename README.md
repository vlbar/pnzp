### Installing
A number of steps that will tell you how to run my code on your computer: 
1. If you do not have an archiver installed on your computer, you can use the free 7zip archiver, which can be downloaded from the official website https://8d9.ru/program/7-zip-zs 
2. Unarchive the downloaded file using the context menu of the 7zip archiver. To do this, find the archive you downloaded with the source code. Right-click on the archive with the program, select "7Zip > Unzip" in the menu that opens. In the window that opens, specify the path to the folder where we are unpacking the archive (if the path to the folder is not specified, the archive will be extracted to the folder with the name of the archive) and click "OK". 
3. Run the NetBeans IDE program. If you don't have it, you can also download It from the official website https://www.download3k.com/Install-NetBeans-IDE.html 
4. In the NetBeans IDE, select "File > Open project..."
5. This opens a selection tool that uses a single unified interface to allow the user to select files and folders from the file system or from other applications. Find the folder where you unpacked the source code (from point 2) and click "Open project"
